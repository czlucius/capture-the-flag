# Wave

Category: Forensics

Challenge Text:  
`I love this spectrum. My kind of vibe.`

Challenge files: [wave.wav](wave.wav)

## Solving the challenge
When playing the audio, we hear a noisy sound, which sounds like information is hidden in the spectrogram.

Let's open the file in Audacity. Create a new project and import the wav file. Afterwards, right click the left pane, and switch to "Spectrogram"
